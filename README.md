# Wine_Quality_Prediction_LinearR
Machine Learning model to predict Quality of Wine using Linear Regression

## Linear Regression Analysis on Wine data - Pre-processing data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Building a model, Check assumptions
This dataset is taken from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset"
This data frame contains the following columns:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):\
1 - fixed acidity\
2 - volatile acidity\
3 - citric acid\
4 - residual sugar\
5 - chlorides\
6 - free sulfur dioxide\
7 - total sulfur dioxide\
8 - density\
9 - pH\
10 - sulphates\
11 - alcohol\
